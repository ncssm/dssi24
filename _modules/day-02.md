At the start of this session, participants will be given tips on where to find data sets and how to prepare them to be used in lessons. After choosing a data set, youâ€™ll work with other participants to create a data story that youâ€™ll use to design tasks and make up questions for students to answer. Finally, youâ€™ll be guided through the process of developing a Jupyter notebook for your lesson.
