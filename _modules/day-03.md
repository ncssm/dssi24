2:30pm
: **Technology**{: .label .label-yellow} MyST Markdown
: Help you and your students write technical documents that are designed to highlight working with computational notebooks. This interdisciplinary tool can build beautiful websites and print articles with an eye towards data anlaysis and code generated figures.

### Everyone!
5:30pm
: **üçª Happy Hour Reception**
: Come grab a drink and socialize this evening at Fonta Flora brewery, right across the street from The Fairfield Inn and Suites in downtown Morganton. We have the side room reserved for our event.
